What is a Factory?
 - An object for creating objects. (for "heavy" instantiation)
  => reuse

Why?
 - Allows for a flexbible and extensible application (changing the implementation of the ShippingProvider, or introduction a new one, without having to change the 
 implementation of the ShippingCart).

Flavors:
 - Simple Factory (Simple Factory Class)
 - Factory Method 
 - Abstract Factory

The client code no longer needs to know about the internal instantiation logic.
