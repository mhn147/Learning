# What is a Design Pattern?
 - General, reusable solution to a commonly occuring [code design] problem with a givin context

## Why should I learn design patterns?
 - Avoid reinventing the wheel..
 - Improve communication "**lingo**"
 - Deliver better software.
 - Advance your career.

## How should I learn design patterns?
 ### Stages of learning:
  1. Ignorance 
  2. Awakening (design patterns aware - but not should about when and how to apply them)
  3. Overzealous
  4. Mastery (Applied and Internalize the patterns. Also recognize when to use a pattern)
 ### T-Shapred approach:
  - Breadth of Patterns (reach "Awakening" level for a large number of patterns, but make sure to "Master" the patterns that you would
		commonly use).

## What Makes Up a Design Pattern?
 - Name and Classification
 - Intent
 - Also Known As
 - Motivation or Scenario
 - Applicability or Context
 - Structure (UML)
 - Participants (Objects, Classes)
 - Collaboration
 - Consequences
 - Implementation
 - Sample Code
 - Known Uses
 - Related Patterns

  ### The Bare Minumum to Know (For Awekening): 
   - Name(s)
   - Intent
   - Motivation and Applicability

## When I should apply a design pattern?
 ### Practice (first):
  - Do a coding exercice or kata
  - Write tests to verify understanding
  - Repeat several times with variations (other patterns?)
 ### In Real Code:
  - Follow refactoring fundamentals
  - Make sure you have test coverage
  - Do the work in a separate branch
  - Verify behavior is consistent after completing the refactoring
  - Be prepared to revert if it doesn't work :p

## Common Patterns to learn (Starting Point)
 - Strategy
 - Repository
 - Adapter
 - Factory
 - Proxy/Decorator
 - Singleton (Anti Pattern??)
